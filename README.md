# Welcome to sannicJP's GitHub Profile üëã

Hello there! I'm a budding Cyber Security enthusiast, currently deep in the trenches of learning all about the fascinating world of cybersecurity. As a student, I'm immersing myself in various aspects of this field, constantly seeking out challenges and opportunities to expand my skill set.

## About Me üìö

I'm on a journey to understand the intricacies of cyber security, from the ground up. My GitHub space here is primarily a collection of notes, projects, and experiments that I've undertaken as part of my learning process. I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and resources, hoping that they might assist others on their learning path as well.

## SMB Network Project üåê

### Overview 
This repository documents the completion of our project to build a Small/Medium Business (SMB) network. Our aim was to create a comprehensive network infrastructure encompassing various components essential for a typical SMB setup. Throughout the project, we focused on collaboration, learning, and implementing security best practices to ensure the integrity and reliability of our network.

### Components Built: üîå

- **LAN, DMZ, and Guest Network**:
Configured distinct network segments to segregate traffic based on security requirements.
- **Windows Domain Environment**: Implemented a Windows domain environment for centralized user authentication and resource management.
- **IIS Webserver**: Deployed a Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web server to host web applications and services.
- **Windows FTP Server**: Set up a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server on a Windows platform to facilitate file sharing and transfer.
- **Windows 10 Workstation**: Provisioned a Windows 10 workstation to simulate end-user computing within the network environment.
- **LAMP Webserver on Ubuntu**: Deployed a Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP) stack on Ubuntu to host a wiki platform for collaborative documentation.
 - **FortiGate Firewall**: Implemented a FortiGate firewall to enforce network security policies, with a Virtual IP (VIP) configured for the DMZ web server.
   
## Collaboration and Hardening üõ°Ô∏è

Throughout the project:

Collaboration: We actively collaborated on researching and implementing hardening techniques to enhance the security posture of our network infrastructure.
Learning Opportunity: The project served as an excellent learning opportunity, allowing us to gain practical experience in network design, configuration, and security.

## Vulnerability Scanning and Reporting üîç

As part of our final project phase:

Vulnerability Scanning: Utilized Green Bone vulnerability scanner to assess the security posture of our network.
Reporting: Generated a detailed report using DokuWiki to document the findings and recommendations for mitigating identified vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

Our SMB network project was not only a fulfilling learning experience but also an enjoyable journey working alongside our team. We successfully completed all requirements, including the deployment of network components, collaboration on hardening techniques, and conducting vulnerability assessments. We are confident that the skills and knowledge gained from this project will be valuable in our future endeavors in the field of networking and cybersecurity.
