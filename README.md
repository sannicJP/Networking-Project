Hello there! I'm a budding Cyber Security enthusiast, currently deep in the trenches of learning all about the fascinating world of cybersecurity. As a student, I'm immersing myself in various aspects of this field, constantly seeking out challenges and opportunities to expand my skill set.

## About Me üìö

I'm on a journey to understand the intricacies of cyber security, from the ground up. My GitHub space here is primarily a collection of notes, projects, and experiments that I've undertaken as part of my learning process. I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and resources, hoping that they might assist others on their learning path as well.

## SMB Network Project üõ°Ô∏è

### Overview 
This repository documents the completion of our project to build a Small/Medium Business (SMB) network. Our aim was to create a comprehensive network infrastructure encompassing various components essential for a typical SMB setup. Throughout the project, we focused on collaboration, learning, and implementing security best practices to ensure the integrity and reliability of our network.

### Components Built:

- **LAN, DMZ, and Guest Network**:
Configured distinct network segments to segregate traffic based on security requirements.
- **Proxychains**: Leveraged proxychains to obscure my attacks, routing through multiple proxies to conceal my location and evade detection.
- **Windows Domain Environment**: Implemented a Windows domain environment for centralized user authentication and resource management.
- **IIS Webserver**: Deployed a Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web server to host web applications and services.
- **Windows FTP Server**: Set up a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server on a Windows platform to facilitate file sharing and transfer.
  - **Windows 10 Workstation**: Provisioned a Windows 10 workstation to simulate end-user computing within the network environment.
  - **LAMP Webserver on Ubuntu**: Deployed a Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP) stack on Ubuntu to host a wiki platform for collaborative documentation.
 - **FortiGate Firewall**: Implemented a FortiGate firewall to enforce network security policies, with a Virtual IP (VIP) configured for the DMZ web server.
   
## My Learning Philosophy üå±

I believe in the hands-on approach to learning, where making mistakes is just another step towards mastery. The projects and notes you'll find here are a testament to this journey, reflecting both successes and learning opportunities.
